This is the WebUI Client for LibreVM, a Censorship Oriented Tool to connect you to a virtual machine hosted in another location.

# Getting Started
You'll want access to a LibreVM Server, which typically is hosted by someone far away, but can work on your own machine, using your Local Session ID.
```python3 -m http.server 8000``` will host a server you can connect to, assuming you're in the directory with index.html. Check console output for the URL.
